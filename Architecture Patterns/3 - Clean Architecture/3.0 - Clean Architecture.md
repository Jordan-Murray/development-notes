[ASP.NET Core - Clean Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGa7SLk1-0Q)

### **Key Concepts**
- **Core Layer**: Defines the business domain, including entities, domain events, and business rules. This layer is technology-agnostic and reusable.
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and workflows. It depends on the Core layer for business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements external dependencies like databases, APIs, and other services.
- **API Layer**: Handles interaction with users or external systems via controllers or APIs.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Shared logic like logging, validation, and configuration.

### **Overview of Layers**
- The Core and Application layers are the most stable and reusable.
- Infrastructure and UI layers handle external dependencies and presentation logic.
