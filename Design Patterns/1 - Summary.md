[Design Patterns in C# and .NET](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet)

- **Summary**
    - Original Gang of Four book first introduced the concept of modern design patterns using C++ and SmallTalk 
    - Design patterns are typically split into three categories, this is called Gamma Categorisation after Erich Gamma, one of the authors of GoF
      - **Creational Patterns**
        - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
        - Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection)
        - Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step by step)
      - **Structural Patterns**
        - Concerned with the structure (e.g class members)
        - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
        - Stress the importance of good API design. 
      - **Behavioral Patterns**
        - No central theme! They're all different.
        - Each solve a particular problem with a particular set of concerns.
