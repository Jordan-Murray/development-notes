# Development Notes

Welcome to my development-notes repository! This repo is a collection of personal notes, code examples, and learning resources compiled from my ongoing technical upskilling journey. The goal of this repository is to document the knowledge Iâ€™m acquiring, primarily focusing on C# development, asynchronous programming, and other advanced software development concepts.
